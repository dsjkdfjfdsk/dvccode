1. Objective: Uses given input and output files from user to output each line of the input file with an @ character

2. Requirements
INPUT:
inputFile
outputFile

PROCESSING:
1. Get user input for input file and output file
2. Open and reads input file, outputting lines with an @ character

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
line

DATA:
inputFile = the user's choice for his or her input file (text)
outputFile = the user's choice for his or her output file (text)
continueYN = if the user wants to continue or not (text)
line = the line of text with the @ char (text)
counter = the counter for reading the file (whole number)
lengthLine = length of text line to count to (whole number)
countofAts = the amount of ats (whole number)

3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "Uses given input and output files from user to output each line of the input file with an @ character"
20 set countofAts = 0
*** Get user input for input file and change default output file to that if entered***
40 output prompt: "Enter input filename [default: fileContainingEmails.txt]: " 
50 input inputFile
60 if length of inputFile is not 0, skip to step 79
73 inputFile = "fileContainingEmails.txt"
77 outputFile = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt"
78 skip to step 80
79 outputFile = inputFile 
*** Get user input for output file ***
80 output prompt: "Enter output filename [default: " + outputFile +"]"
90 input outputFile
91 if length of outputFile is not 0, skip to step 100
92 if length of outputFile is 0 and outputFile = "fileContainingEmails.txt", skip to step 97
93 outputFile = inputFile
94 skip to step 100
97 outputFile = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt"
*** Output respective files ***
100 output label: "Input file: " + inputFile
110 output label: "Output file: " + outputFile
*** See if user wants to continue ***
130 output prompt: "press ENTER key to continue or ANY key to exit: "
140 input continueYN
150 if length of continueYN is 0, skip to step 170
160 skip to step 300
*** Reads file ***
170 open inputFile
180 counter = 0
181 if we are at the end of the file, skip to step 230
182 get current line from inputFile and put that value into line
183 lengthline = line.length()
185 if counter >= lengthLine, skip to step 180
190 if line[counter] isn't @, skip to step 210
200 output line
205 countofAts = countofAts + 1
210 counter = counter + 1
220 skip to step 185
*** Check to see if there were no ats ***
230 if countofAts > 0, skip to step 300
240 output label: "You had no @'s in your file!"
*** END ***
300 END

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user types nothing for both input and output filenames. Input file has 1 line that says @@@@
Input: inputFile = "", outputFile ="" , continueYN = ""
Output: 
Input file: fileContainingEmails.txt
Output file: copyPasteMyEmails.txt
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
