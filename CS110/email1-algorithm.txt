2. Requirements
INPUT:
inputFile
outputFile

2. Output user choices for input and output file

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
inputFile
outputFile

DATA:
inputFile = the user's choice for his or her input file (text)
outputFile = the user's choice for his or her output file (text)
continueYN = if the user wants to continue or not (text)

3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "Determines what the user wants for input and output files"
*** Get user input for input file and change default output file to that if entered***
40 output prompt: "Enter input filename [default: fileContainingEmails.txt]: " 
50 input inputFile
60 if length of inputFile is not 0, skip to step 79
73 inputFile = "fileContainingEmails.txt"
77 outputFile = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt"
78 skip to step 80
79 outputFile = inputFile 
*** Get user input for output file ***
80 output prompt: "Enter output filename [default: " + outputFile +"]"
90 input outputFile
91 if length of outputFile is not 0, skip to step 100
92 if length of outputFile is 0 and outputFile = "fileContainingEmails.txt", skip to step 97
93 outputFile = inputFile
94 skip to step 100
97 outputFile = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt"
*** See if user wants to continue ***
100 output prompt: "press ENTER key to continue or ANY key to exit: "
110 input continueYN
120 if length of continueYN is 0, skip to step 160
150 skip to step 180
*** Output respective files ***
160 output label: "Input file: " + inputFile
170 output label: "Output file: " + outputFile
180 END


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user types nothing for both input and output filenames
Input: inputFile = "", outputFile ="" , continueYN = ""
Output: 
Input file: fileContainingEmails.txt
Output file: copyPasteMyEmails.txt
10 Determines what the user wants for input and output files
40 Enter input filename [default: fileContainingEmails.txt]: 
50 inputFile = ""
60 false
73 inputFile = "fileContainingEmails.txt"
77 outputFile = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt"
80 Enter output filename [default: copyPasteMyEmails.txt]: 
90 outputFile = ""
91 false
92 true
97 outputFile = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt"
100 press ENTER key to continue or Q to exit: 
110 continueYN = ""
120 true
160 Input file: fileContainingEmails.txt
170 Output file: copyPasteMyEmails.txt
180 END

Test Case #2
The user types an input file as "x.txt" but enters nothing for output file
Input: inputFile = "x.txt", outputFile ="" , continueYN = ""
Output: 
Input file: x.txt
Output file: x.txt
10 Determines what the user wants for input and output files
40 Enter input filename [default: fileContainingEmails.txt]: 
50 inputFile = "x.txt"
60 true
79 outputFile = "x.txt"
80 Enter output filename [default: x.txt]: 
91 false
92 false
93 outputFile = x.txt
100 press ENTER key to continue or Q to exit: 
110 continueYN = ""
120 true
160 Input file: x.txt
170 Output file: x.txt
180 END

Test Case #3
The user types nothing for the input file and "y.txt" for the output file
Input: inputFile = "", outputFile ="y.txt" , continueYN = ""
Output: 
Input file: fileContainingEmails.txt
Output file: y.txt
10 Determines what the user wants for input and output files
40 Enter input filename [default: fileContainingEmails.txt]: 
50 inputFile = ""
60 false
73 inputFile = "fileContainingEmails.txt"
77 outputFile = "copyPasteMyEmails.txt"
80 Enter output filename [default: copyPasteMyEmails.txt]: 
90 outputFile = "y.txt"
91 true
100 press ENTER key to continue or Q to exit: 
110 continueYN = ""
120 true
160 Input file: fileContainingEmails.txt
170 Output file: y.txt
180 END

Test Case #4
The user types "x.txt" for the input file, "y.txt" for the output file
Input: inputFile = "x.txt", outputFile ="y.txt" , continueYN = ""
Output: 
Input file: x.txt
Output file: y.txt
10 Determines what the user wants for input and output files
40 Enter input filename [default: fileContainingEmails.txt]: 
50 inputFile = "x.txt"
60 true
70 outputFile = "x.txt"
79 outputFile = "x.txt"
80 Enter output filename [default: x.txt]: 
90 outputFile = "y.txt"
91 true
100 press ENTER key to continue or Q to exit: 
110 continueYN = ""
