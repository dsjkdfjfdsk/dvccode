1. Objective: calculate the average, highest, lowest scores and number of scores greater than the average, using a linked list

2. Requirements
INPUT:
NONE

PROCESSING:
1. Read scores from input file
2. Calculate average, highest, lowest score, number of scores greater than average

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
highest
lowest
nGreater
average

DATA:
average = the average of all the numbers (decimal)
nGreater = the number of scores greater than average (whole number)
highest = the highest score (whole number)
lowest = the lowest score (whole number)
currentLineNumber = the current line of the file (whole number)
sum = sum of all numbers (whole number)
count = count of numbers (whole number)
listNumbers = linked list of the currentLines (list)
i = counter for calculating nGreater, lowest, highest (whole number)

3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "calculate the average, highest, lowest scores and number of scores greater than the average, using a linked list"
*** Initialize values ***
20 set average = 0
30 set nGreater = 0
40 set nLower = 0
50 set highest = 0
60 set lowest = 0
65 set currentLineNumber = 0
*** Read file ***
70 open "scores.txt"
75 if at the end of the file, skip to step 135
80 for the line currentLineNumber, read the line and store it into currentLine
85 add currentLine to listNumbers linked list
110 sum = sum + currentLine
120 count = count + 1
125 currentLineNumber = currentLineNumber + 1
130 skip to step 75
135 highest = currentLine
136 lowest = currentLine
137 close "scores.txt"
*** Calculate average ***
140 average = sum / count 
*** Calculate nGreater ***
145 if i > count, skip to step 180
147 if item i in listNumbers > highest, highest = currentLine
148 if item i in listNumbers < lowest, lowest = currentLine 
150 for item i in listNumbers, if it's less than or equal average, skip to step 170
160 nGreater = nGreater + 1
170 i = i + 1
175 skip to step 145
*** Output results ***
180 output label: "Average: " + average
190 output label: "Highest: " + highest
200 output label: "Lowest: " + lowest 
210 output label: "Number of scores greater than average: " + nGreater

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
User types in 10, and 20 in scores.txt
Input: 
Output:
Average: 15
Highest: 20
Lowest: 10
Number of scores greater than average: 1

10 calculate the average, highest, lowest scores and number of scores greater than the average, using a linked list

75 false
80 currentLine = 10
85 10 added to listNumbers list
