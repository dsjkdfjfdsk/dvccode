1. Objective: Decodes the user line of input so that each character is converted to the previous character in the ASCII code. 

2. Requirements
INPUT:
userText

PROCESSING:
1. Get encoded text from user 
2. Decode the encoded text by decreasing each character in the text by 1 ASCII code. 

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
userDecoded

DATA:
userText = the user line of text that is inputted (text)
userDecoded = the user line of text decoded so that each char is converted to the previous char (text)
userTextLength = the length of the userText length (whole number)
i = the current index of the userText that is being translated to ASCII (whole number)

3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "Decodes the user line of input so that each character is converted to the previous character in the ASCII code."
*** Get user input for the line of text ***
20 output prompt: "Please type in an encoded line of text with spaces and punctuation (if applicable): "
30 input userText
*** Decodes userText to ASCII***
40 set userDecoded = ""
50 set userTextLength = userText.length()
60 set i = 0
70 if i >= userTextLength, skip to step 200
80 userDecoded = userDecoded + (userText[i] - 1)
90 i = i + 1
100 skip to step 70
*** Output userDecoded ***
200 output userDecoded 
210 END

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user types BC for the line of text
Input: userText = "BC"
Output: AB

10 Decodes the user line of input so that each character is converted to the previous character in the ASCII code.
20 Please type in an encoded line of text with spaces and punctuation (if applicable): 
30 userText = "BC"
40 set userDecoded = ""
50 set userTextLength = 2
60 set i = 0
70 false
80 userDecoded = "" + ("A") = "A"
90 i = 0 + 1 = 1
70 false
80 userDecoded = "A" + ("B") = "AB"
90 i = 1 + 1 = 2
70 true
200 AB
210 END
