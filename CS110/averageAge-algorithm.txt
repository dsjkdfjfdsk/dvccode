Course: COMSC-110-1021

1. Objective: Calculate the average age of everyone in the classroom. 

2. Requirements
INPUT: 
age

PROCESSING: (a list of the major parts of the problem or objective (that will become the code blocks in a program))
1. getting each age of everyone in the room. 
2. getting the total number of people in the room.
3. sum the age of each person in the room.
4. dividing the sum of the ages by the number of people in the room. 

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
average

DATA: (name of data item, definition, data type, valid values)
count = number of people in the room (whole number)
age = number of years old of each person in the room (whole number) (0-122)
sum = total of all ages of all the people in the room (whole number)
average = the average age of all the people in the room (decimal)

3. Instructions
10. output the introduction: "Calculate the average age of everyone in the room by COMSC-110-1021 class"
15. set sum = 0
16. set count = 0
17. set average = 0
*** gettting the age of everyone in the room ***
*** getting the total number of people in the room ***
*** sum all the ages of the people in the room ***
18. If there are no people in the room, jump to step 70. 
20. output the prompt: "What is your age? (0-122) (-1 or in case nobody in the room to exit)"
30. input age
31. if age is equal to -1, skip to instruction 70.
35. if age is greater than or equal to 0 or less than or equal to 122, skip to instruction 40. 
36. ouput the prompt: "Invalid age. Please reenter an age between 0-122: "
37. skip to instruction 20
40. set sum = sum + age
50. set count = count + 1
60. if there are uncounted people left in the room, then skip to instruction 20
*** calculate the average age ***
70. if count is not 0, set average = sum / count
75. if count is 0, output label "there are no people in the room"
76. 
80. output label "the average age of everyone in the room is " + average
90. END or EXIT

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:	and the expected results:
There are 3 people in the room
Input: ages are 21, 31, 41
Expected results: count = 3, sum = 93, average = 93/3 = 31
10 Calculate the average age of everyone in the room by COMSC-110-1021 class
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
18 False
20 What is your age?
30 age = 21
35 False
40 sum = 0 + 21 = 21
50 count = 0 + 1 = 1
60 True so skip to instruction 20
20 What is your age?
30 age = 31
35 False
40 sum = 21 + 31 = 52
50 count = 1 + 1 = 2
60 True so skip to instruction 20
20 What is your age?
30 age = 41
35 False
40 sum = 52 + 41 = 93
50 count = 2 + 1 =3
60 False
70 average = 93 / 3 = 31
80 The average age of everyone in the room is 31
90 DONE

Test Case #2: 
There are 3 people in the room
Input: ages are -1, 31, 41
Expected results: Invalid age, try again
10 Calculate the average age of everyone in the room by COMSC-110-1021 class
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your age?
30 age = -1
35 True
90 DONE

Test Case #3: 
There are 0 people in the room 
Input: -1
Expected Results: There are no people in the room
10 Calculate the average age of everyone in the room by COMSC-110-1021 class
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
18 True
90 DONE

Test Case #4:
There is 1 person in the room
Input: age is 200
Expected Results: Invalid age, try again
10 Calculate the average age of everyone in the room by COMSC-110-1021 class
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your age?
30 age = 200
35 False
90 DONE
