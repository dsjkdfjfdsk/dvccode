1. Objective: Play the Mastermind game and keeps score

2. Requirements
INPUT:
guess

PROCESSING:
1. Get user guess for the 4 letter combination
2. Evaluate how many correct colors they got and correct positions they got compared to the computer choices

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
correctColors
correctPositions

DATA:
guess = 4 letter combination of B, G, R, Y, O, and P inputted by user (text) (Any 4 letter combination of B for Blue, G for Green, R for Red, O for Orange, Y for Yellow, and P for Pink)
computerChoices = 4 letter combination of B, G, R, Y, O, and P randomly generated by computer (text) (Any 4 letter combination of B for Blue, G for Green, R for Red, O for Orange, Y for Yellow, and P for Pink)
correctColors = Number of correct colors (whole number) (0-4)
correctPositions = Number of correct positions (whole number) (0-4)
counter = counter value for checking each letter (whole number)
tries = number of tries the user has done (whole number)
computerScore = computer's score (whole number)
userScore = user's score

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user guesses "RGYB", computer generated answer is "RGYB"
Input: guess = "RGYB"
Output: 
The number of correct colors is: 4
The number of correct positions is: 4
You Won! Congrats!
