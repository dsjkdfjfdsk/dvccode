1. Objective: Prompt the user to input 4 numbers between 0 and 100, and calculate the average of those 4 numbers, and how many of those 4 numbers are above the average.

2. Requirements:
--INPUT
4 numbers between 0-100

--PROCESSING
input 4 numbers
calculate the average 
compare each of the 4 numbers to the average to count how many of those 4 numbers are greater than the average
output average
output number of the 4 input numbers are greater than the average

--OUTPUT

user Instructions: You will be prompted for 4 numbers to get the average and how many of those numbers are above the average.
prompt1: "Please enter a number [0-100]: "
label1: "The average of "
label2: " numbers is "
label3: ".  "
label4: " numbers are greater than the average."


--Data
array-Numbers defined for 4 values-->>stores 4 input values from the user (integer)
average-->>calculated average of 4 values input (decimal)
nGreater-->>calculated number of input values that are greater than the calculated average (integer)
sum-->>sum of input values (integer)
count-->>count input values (integer)
i-->>loop iteration index (integer)

4. Test Cases
Test Case #1: input values = 64, 94, 94, 94.  Expected results = 86.5 and 3 values are greater than the average.
10 Prompt the user to input 4 numbers between 0 and 100, and calculate the average of those 4 numbers, and how many of those 4 numbers are above the average.
