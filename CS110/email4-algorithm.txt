Course: COMSC-110-1021

1. Objective: Uses given input and output files from user to output every valid email address to console, skipping case-independent duplicates. 

2. Requirements
INPUT:
inputFile
outputFile

PROCESSING:
1. data
2. introduction
3. input filenames (input and output) using variable prompts and default filenames
4. Open and reads input file, outputting each valid email

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
validEmail

DATA:
inputFile = the user's choice for his or her input file (text)
outputFile = the user's choice for his or her output file (text)
continueYN = if the user wants to continue or not (text)
line = the line of text with the @ char (text)
counter = the counter for reading the file (whole number)
lengthLine = length of text line to count to (whole number)
countofEmails = the numebr of valid emails (whole number)
s = counter for checking valid input for the text before the @ sign (whole number)
e = counter for checking valid input for the text after the @ sign (whole number)
validEmail = if the email character is valid (boolean)
hasDot = if there is a dot or not (boolean)
currentEmail = the currentEmail being looked at (string)
emailList = list of emails (list)

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user types nothing for both input and output filenames. Input file has 1 line that says <e@y.com> and another line that says ^e@y.com^
Input: inputFile = "", outputFile ="" , continueYN = ""
Output: 
Input file: fileContainingEmails.txt
Output file: copyPasteMyEmails.txt
