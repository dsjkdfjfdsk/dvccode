1. Objective: Calculate a value in the "Fibonacci number" series

2. Requirements
INPUT:
numberSequence

PROCESSING:
1. Get user input for what fibonacci number they want
2. Calculate fibonacci number

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
fib

DATA:
numberSequence = user input for the specific number of the fibonacci series (whole number) (0 or positive)
counter = counter for fibonacci calculations (whole number) (0 or positive)
fib = the fibonacci number (whole number) (0 or positive)
a = first fibonacci number which will change for calculations (whole number) 
b = second fibonacci number which will change for calculations (whole number) 

3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "Calculate a value in the "Fibonacci number" series"
12 output instructions: "Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones."
13 output example: "For example, here are the first 5 fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3. Index 3 would be 2."
15 set fib = 1
16 set counter = 3
17 set a = 1
18 set b = 1
*** Get user input ***
20 output prompt: "Enter an index [0 or greater]: "
30 input numberSequence 
40 if numberSequence > 0, skip to step 70
50 output label: "Invalid number. Please try again with a number 0 or greater."
60 skip to step 20
*** Calculate fibonacci number ***
70 if counter >= numberSequence, skip to step 130
80 fib = a + b
81 a = b
82 b = fib
85 counter = counter + 1
90 skip to step 70
*** Output answer ***
130 output label: "The Fibonacci number at index " + numberSequence + " is " + fib

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user wants to get the 6th index
Input: numberSequence = 6
Output: The Fibonacci number at index 6 is 8.

10 Calculate a value in the "Fibonacci number" series
12 Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
13 For example, here are the first 5 fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3. Index 3 would be 2.
15 fib = 1
16 counter = 3
17 a = 1
18 b = 1
20 Enter an index [0 or greater]: 
30 numberSequence = 6
40 true
70 false
80 fib = 1 + 1 = 2
81 a = 1
82 b = 2
85 counter = 3 + 1 = 4
70 false
80 fib = 1 + 2 = 3
81 a = 2
82 b = 3
85 counter = 4 + 1 = 5
70 false
80 fib = 2 + 3 = 5
81 a = 3
82 b = 5
85 counter = 5 + 1 = 6
70 false
80 fib = 3 + 5 = 8
81 a = 5
82 b = 8
85 counter = 6 + 1 = 7
70 true
130 The Fibonacci number at index 6 is 8.

Test Case #2:
The user types an invalid index such as -1
Input: numberSequence = -1
Output: Invalid number. Please try again with a number 0 or greater.

40 false
50 Invalid number. Please try again with a number 0 or greater.
