1. Objective: User guesses a number between 1 and 10 and sees if it's correct

2. Requirements
INPUT:
guess

PROCESSING:
1. Generate random number
2. Get user's guess
3. Compare user input to the random number and output results and continue steps 2-3 until input is correct

OUTPUT:
message (either gonna be "Try again..." or "You guessed it. Congrats!" or "I really want a number between 1 and 10 (type -1 to EXIT):")

DATA:
guess = the user's guess (whole number) (1-100)
number = the correct number which is randomly generated (whole number) (1-100)

3. Instructions
10 output the introduction: "User guesses a number between 1 and 10 and sees if it's correct"
*** getting the user input ***
20 output the prompt: "What is your guess [1-10] (whole number): "
30 input guess
31 if guess is between 1-100, skip to step 40
32 output the prompt: "I really want a number between 1 and 10 (type -1 to EXIT): "
33 skip to step 30
34 if guess is -1, skip to step 200
35 skip to 31
36 if guess is not a number gussed previously, skip to step 40
37 output label: "You already guessed" + guess + ". Guess again"
38 skip to step 20
*** generate random number ***
40 number = rand() % 10 + 1
*** compares guess to correct number to see if it is corret or not ***
50 if guess is equal to number, skip to step 110
60 if guess is bigger than number, skip to step 80
70 output label: "That's too high. guess again: "
80 skip to step 30
90 if guess is bigger than number, skip to step 120
100 output label: "That's too low. guess again: "
110 skip to step 30
120 output the label: "You guessed it. Congrats!"
200 EXIT

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user guesses 4 and gets it correctly
Input: guess = 4
Output: You guessed it. Congrats!
10 User guesses a number between 1 and 10 and see if it's correct
20 What is your guess [1-10] (whole number):
30 guess = 4
31 true
40 number = rand() % 10 + 1 = 4
50 true
80 output the label: "You guessed it. Congrats!"
200 EXIT

Test Case #2:
The user guesses -1
Input: guess = -1
Output: I really want a number between 1 and 10 (type -1 to EXIT): 
10 User guesses a number between 1 and 10 and see if it's correct
20 What is your guess [1-10] (whole number):
30 guess = -1
31 false
32 I really want a number between 1 and 10 (type -1 to EXIT): 

Test Case #3:
The user guesses nothing and doesn't want to guess
Input: guess = 
Output: 
10 User guesses a number between 1 and 10 and see if it's correct
20 What is your guess [1-10] (whole number):
30 guess = 
31 false
32 I really want a number between 1 and 10 (type -1 to EXIT): 
33 guess = -1
34 true
200 EXIT
