1. Objective: Converts each of the user input's character to the next character in the ASCII code.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
userText

PROCESSING:
1. Get user input for the line of text to be encoded
2. Encode the user input by increasing each character in the text by 1 ASCII value

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
userASCII

DATA:
userText = the line entered by the user (text)
userASCII = the user's line of text translated to the next character in the ASCII code (text)
userTextLength = the length of the userText length (whole number)
i = the current index of the userText that is being translated to ASCII (whole number)

3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "Converts each of the user input's character to the next character in the ASCII code."
*** Get user input for the line of text ***
20 output prompt: "Please type in a line of text with spaces and punctuation if applicable: "
30 input userText
*** Encode userText to ASCII***
40 set userASCII = ""
50 set userTextLength = userText.length()
60 set i = 0
70 if i >= userTextLength, skip to step 200
80 userASCII = userASCII + (userText[i] + 1)
90 i = i + 1
100 skip to step 70
*** Output userASCII ***
200 output userASCII 
210 END


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user types AB for the line of text
Input: userText = "AB"
Output: BC

10 Converts each of the user input's character to the next character in the ASCII code
20 Please type in a line of text with spaces and punctuation if applicable: 
30 userText = "AB"
40 userASCII = ""
50 userTextLength = 2
60 i = 0
70 false
80 userASCII = "" + ("B") = "B"
90 i = 0 + 1 = 1
70 false
80 userASCII = "B" + ("C") = "BC"
90 i = 1 + 1 = 2
70 true
200 BC
210 END
