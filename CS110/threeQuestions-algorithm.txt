1. Objective: Asks three questions tells the user if they answered them correctly

2. Requirements
INPUT:
userAnswer 

PROCESSING:
1. Get user answers for each question
2. Evaluate if the answer is correct and adds 1 point to the score if correct 

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
correctness
score

DATA:
answer = correct answer to the question (whole number)
question = the question (text)
userAnswer = the user's input to the question (whole number)
correctness = true or false (boolean)
score = the total number of correct answers from user (whole number) (0 or any positive whole number)
currentStep = the current step of the instruction (int)

3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "Asks three questions tells the user if they answered them correctly"
***Asks three questions***
20 set question = "How many bits in a byte?"
30 set answer = 8
31 set currentStep = 41
40 jump to step 150 (subprogram) 
41 if correctness == false, skip to step 48
42 output label: "Correct!"
43 score = score + 1
44 skip to step 50
48 output label: "Incorrect, but a better answer would be " + answer
50 question = "How many bytes in a int?"
60 answer = 4
61 currentStep = 71
70 jump to step 150 (subprogram) 
71 if correctness == false, skip to step 78
72 output label: "Correct!"
73 score = score + 1
74 skip to step 80
78 output label: "Incorrect, but a better answer would be " + answer
80 question = "How many bytes in a long long?"
90 answer = 8
91 currentStep = 101
100 jump to step 150 (subprogram) 
101 if correctness == false, skip to step 105
102 output label: "Correct!"
103 score = score + 1
104 skip to step 150
105 output label: "Incorrect, but a better answer would be " + answer
110 skip to step 220
*** Subprogram to determine if user answer is correct***
150 output question as a prompt
160 input userAnswer 
170 if answer == userAnswer, skip to step 200
180 correctness = false
190 skip back to the previous step currentStep 
200 correctness = true
210 skip back to previous step currentStep
*** Output results ***
220 output label "That's " + score + " correct out of 3 questions asked";
310 END

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user types in 8, 4, 2 as their answers
Input: userAnswer = 8, userAnswer = 4, userAnswer = 2
Output: That's 2 correct out of 3 questions asked
10 Asks three questions tells the user if they answered them correctly
20 question = "How many bits in a byte?"
30 answer = 8
31 currentStep = 41
150 How many bits in a byte?
160 userAnswer = 8
170 true
200 correctness = true
210 skip back to previous step 41
41 false
42 Correct!
43 score = 0 + 1 = 1
50 question = "How many bytes in a int?"
60 answer = 4
61 currentStep = 71
150 How many bytes in a int?
160 userAnswer = 4
170 true
200 correctness = true
71 false
72 Correct!
73 score = 1 + 1 = 2
80 question = "How many bytes in a long long?"
90 answer = 8
91 currentStep = 101
150 How many bytes in a long long?
160 userAnswer = 2
170 true
180 correctness = false
190 skip back to the previous step 101
101 true
105 Incorrect, but a better answer would be 8
220 That's 2 correct out of 3 questions asked
