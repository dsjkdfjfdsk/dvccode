Name: Ethan Chiu
Course: COMSC-110-1021

1. Objective: Converts each line of the user input's (from a file) so that each character is now the next character in the ASCII code.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
filename

PROCESSING:
1. Get user input for the file to be encoded
2. Encode each line of the file by increasing each character in the text by 1 ASCII value

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
userASCII

DATA:
userText = the line currently being encoded (text)
userASCII = the user's line of text translated to the next character in the ASCII code (text)
userTextLength = the length of the userText length (whole number)
i = the current index of the userText that is being translated to ASCII (whole number)
filename = the file name that the userTexts are located (text)
lineNumber = current line number that is being encoded (whole number) 
offset = array of numbers to increase the character by (array) (each number ranging from -20 to 20)
offsetSize = random size (whole number) (5-10)
b = index of the offset array (whole number)

3. Instructions
*** subprogram encodeText ***
*** Get user input for the line of text ***
20 input userText from filename located on lineNumber
*** Encode userText to ASCII***
40 set userASCII = ""
43 set b = 0
50 set userTextLength = userText.length()
60 set i = 0
70 if i >= userTextLength, skip to step 200
75 if b >= offset's size, b = 0
80 userASCII = userASCII + (userText[i] + offset[b])
90 i = i + 1
96 b = b + 1
100 skip to step 70
200 RETURN from subprogram encodeText with userASCII

*** main algorithm ***
10 output introduction: "Converts each line of the user input's (from a file) so that each character is now the next character in the ASCII code."
*** initialize values ***
11 set lineNumber = 0
*** get name of file ***
12 set offsetSize to a random number between 5 and 10
13 create offset array with a random set of numbers ranging from (-20 to 20)
14 open offset.txt and output the offset array into this file
20 output prompt: "Please type in a name of the file (with the .txt extension) : "
30 input filename
40 open filename for input 
50 open secret.txt for output
60 get userASCII from subprogram encodeText 
70 lineNumber = lineNumber + 1
*** append encoded value to secret.txt***
80 output userASCII to secret.txt
90 output userASCII
100 if EOF in filename skip to step 200
110 skip to step 60
*** Close files ***
200 close filename
210 close secret.txt
210 END


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user inputs a filename called "input.txt" with "AB" and "BC", each on a seperate line
Input: filename = "input.txt" 
Output: 
<J
=K

10 Converts each line of the user input's (from a file) so that each character is now the next character in the ASCII code.
11 lineNumber = 0;
13 offset = [-5, 8, 12, 6, 1]
20 Please type in a name of the file (with the .txt extension) : 
30 filename = "input.txt" 
40 open input.txt for input 
60 jump to subprogram encodeText 
20 userText = "AB"
40 userASCII = ""
43 b = 0
50 open secret.txt for output
50 userTextLength = 2
60 i = 0
70 false
75 false
80 userASCII = '' + < = '<'
90 i = 0 + 1 = 1
70 false
80 userASCII = '<' + J = "<J"
90 i = 1 + 1 = 2
70 true
200 RETURN from subprogram encodeText with "<J"
70 lineNumber = 0 + 1 = 1
80 output "<J" to secret.txt
90 <J
100 false
60 jump to subprogram encodeText 
20 userText = "BC"
40 userASCII = ""
50 userTextLength = 2
60 i = 0
70 false
75 false
80 userASCII = "" + ("=") = "="
90 i = 0 + 1 = 1
70 false
75 false
80 userASCII = "=" + ("K") = "=K"
90 i = 1 + 1 = 2
70 true
200 RETURN from subprogram encodeText with "=K"
70 lineNumber = 1 + 1 = 2
80 output "=K" to secret.txt
90 =K
100 true
200 close filename
210 close secret.txt
210 END
