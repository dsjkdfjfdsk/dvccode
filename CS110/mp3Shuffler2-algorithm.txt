3. Instructions
10 output introduction: "reads all song titles from a text file, and randomly select and output titles in a loop until the user wishes to stop"
*** Reads file and stores it into the songs array ***
15 set nSongs = 0
16 set MAXSONGS = 200
17 create lastFiveSongs
20 open "songs.txt"
30 if it is the end of "songs.txt", skip to step 70
40 if nSongs >= MAXSONGS, skip to step 70
45 get string from the current line of the "songs.txt" and store it into currentLine
50 songs[nSongs] = currentLine
55 currentLine = currentLine + 1
60 skip to step 30
*** Get user input to see if they want to play a song ***

80 input userAnswer
90 if userAnswer != y or Y, skip to step 140
100 continueYN = true
101 add userAnswer to lastFiveSongs list
110 generate random number between 0 and nSongs and store it into randomNumber
120 showSong = song[randomNumber]
125 if showSong is in lastFiveSongs list, skip to step 110
130 output showSong
135 skip to step 80
140 if userAnswer n or N, skip to step 170
