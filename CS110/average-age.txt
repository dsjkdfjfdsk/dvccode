1. Objective: Calculate the average age of everyone in the classroom. 

2. Requirements
INPUT: 
age

PROCESSING: (a list of the major parts of the problem or objective (that will become the code blocks in a program))
1. getting each age of everyone in the room. 
1. getting the total number of people in the room.
1. sum the age of each person in the room.
1. dividing the sume of the ages by the number of people in the room. 

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
average

DATA: (name of data item, definition, data type, valid values)
count = number of people in the room (whole number)
age = number of years old of each person in the room (whole number) (0-122)
sum = total of all ages of all the people in the room (whole number)
average = the average age of all the people in the room (decimal)

3. Instructions
1. output the introduction: "Calculate the average of everyone in the room"
1. set sum = 0
1. set count = 0
1. set average = 0
*** gettting the age of everyone in the room ***
*** getting the total number of people in the room ***
*** sum all the ages of the people in the room ***
1. output the prompt: "What is your age?"
1. input age
1. set sum = sum + age
1. set count = count + 1
1. if there are uncounted people left in the room, then skip to instruction 20
*** calculate the average age ***
1. set average = sum / count
1. output label "the average age of everyone in the room is " + average
1. END or EXIT

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:	and the expected results:
There are 3 people in the room
Input: ages are 21, 31, 41
Expected results: count = 3, sum = 93, average = 93/3 = 31

1. "Calculate the average of everyone in the room"
1. sum = 0
1. count = 0
1. average = 0
1. What is your age?
1. age = 21
1. sum = 0 + 21 = 21
1. count = 0 + 1 = 1
1. What is your age?
1. age = 31
1. sum = 21 + 31= 52
1. count = 1 + 1 = 2
1. What is your age?
1. age = 41
1. sum = 52 + 41 = 93
1. count = 2 + 1 = 3
1. False
1. average = 93 / 3 = 31
1. The average age of everyone in the room is 31
1. EXIT

Test Case #2: 
There are 3 people in the room
Input: ages are -1, 31, 41
Expected results: Invalid age, try again

Test Case #3: 
Ther are 0 people in the room
Input:
Expected Results: There are no people in the room
