1. Objective: Determines how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea. 

2. Requirements
INPUT: 
height

PROCESSING: (a list of the major parts of the problem or objective (that will become the code blocks in a program))
1. getting lighthouse's height (in feet) from user. 
2. calculate the distance in miles.
3. output the distance in miles

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
distance

DATA: (name of data item, definition, data type, valid values)
height = the lighthouse's height (in feet) (decimal) (positive)
distance = the distance of how far away a boat can see the lighthouse (in miles) (whole number)

3. Instructions
10. output the introduction: "Determines how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea."
*** getting lighthouse's height (in feet) from user. ***
20. output prompt "What's the lighthouse height in feet (decimal) (positive) ('EXIT' to END)? "
30. input height
31. if height is not 'EXIT', skip to step 35
32. output label 'There is no lighthouse height inputted'
33. skip to step 200
35. if height is a deciml and positive, skip to step 50
37. output prompt "Invalid height. Please type a positive decimal number: "
38. skip to step 30
*** calculate the distance in miles ***
50. distance = sqrt(.894427191 * height)
*** output distance ***
100. output label "A " + height + " foot tall lighthouse can be seen from " + distance + " miles away"
200. END or EXIT

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:	and the expected results:
User types in the height in feet
Input: height is 100.001
Expected results: height = 100.001, distance = 9
10 Determines how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea.
20 What's the lighthouse height in feet (decimal) (positive) ('EXIT' to END)?
30 height = 100.001
31 true
35 true
50 distance = sqrt(.894427191 * 100.001) = 9
100 A 100.001 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from " + 9 + " miles away"
200 END

Test Case #2: 
User types invalid height
Input: height is -10
Expected results: Invalid height. Please type a positive decimal number:
10 Determines how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea.
20 What's the lighthouse height in feet (decimal) (positive) ('EXIT' to END)?
30 height = -10
31 true
35 false
37 Invalid height. Please type a positive decimal number: 

Test Case #3: 
User types in nothing
Input: 
Expected Results: There is no lighthouse height inputted
10 Determines how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea.
20 What's the lighthouse height in feet (decimal) (positive) ('EXIT' to END)?
30 height = EXIT
31 true
32 There is no lighthouse height inputted
200 END
