2. Requirements
INPUT:
height

count = number of people in the room (whole number)
height = height of each person in feet (decimal) (0 to 8 feet)
sum = total of all heights of all the people in the room (decimal)
average = the average height of all the people in the room (decimal)

3. Instructions
10. output the introduction: "Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom"
15. set sum = 0
16. set count = 0
17. set average = 0
*** gettting the height of everyone in the room in feet ***
*** getting the total number of people in the room ***
*** sum all the height of the people in the room ***
18. If there are no people in the room, jump to step 90. 
20. output the prompt: "What is your height?"
30. input height
35. if height is not larger than 0 and less than 8, jump to step 90. 
40. set sum = sum + height
50. set count = count + 1
60. if there are uncounted people left in the room, then skip to instruction 20
*** calculate the average height***
70. set average = sum / count
80. output label "the average height of everyone in the classroom is " + average + "feet"
90. END or EXIT


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:	and the expected results:
There are 3 people in the room
Input: heights are 8 feet, 8 feet, 8 feet
Expected results: count = 3, sum = 330 , average = 330/3 = 110
10 Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
18 False
20 What is your height?
30 height = 8
35 False
40 sum = 0 + 8 = 8
50 count = 0 + 1 = 1
60 True so skip to instruction 20
20 What is your height?
30 height = 8 
35 False
40 sum = 8 + 8 = 16
50 count = 1 + 1 = 2
60 True so skip to instruction 20
20 What is your height?
30 height = 130 
35 False
40 sum = 16 + 8 = 24
50 count = 2 + 1 =3
60 False
70 average = 24 / 3 = 8
80 The average height of everyone in the classroom is 8 feet
90 DONE

Test Case #2: 
There are 3 people in the room
Input: heights are 0, 10, 129
Expected results: Invalid height, try again
10 Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your height?
30 height = -1
35 True
90 DONE

Test Case #3: 
There are 0 people in the classroom
Input:
Expected Results: There are no people in the classroom
10 Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom
