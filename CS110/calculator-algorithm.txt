1. Objective: creates a 4 function calculator 

2. Requirements
INPUT:
first
second
operator

PROCESSING:
1. Get input from the user (first, second, operator)
2. Calculate the result using these inputs

OUTPUT:
result

DATA:
first = the first number (decimal) (all numbers)
second = the second number (decimal) (all numbers)
operator = the operator (whole number) (1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplication  4= division)
result = the result of using the operator with the first and second number (decimal) (all numbers)
nextCalc = the result of whether the user wants to do another operation (character) (either Y or N)

3. Instructions
10 output the introduction: "Creates a 4 function calculator"
*** gettting the first number, second number, and operator ***
20 output the prompt: "Please enter first number: "
30 input first
40 output the prompt: "Please enter second number: "
50 input second
60 output the prompt: "Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: "
70 input operator
80 if operator is 1, 2, 3, or 4, skip to step 110
90 output label "Invalid operator. Please type 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division"
100 skip to step 60
*** do calculation with the operator and the two numbers
110 if the operator is 4, skip to step 170 
120 if the operator is 3, skip to step 160
130 if the operator is 2, skip to step 150
140 result = first + second
145 skip to step 180
150 result = first - second
155 skip to step 190
160 result = first * second
165 skip to step 200
170 result = first / second
175 skip to step 210
**  output result ***
180 output label: first + " + " + second + " = " + result
185 skip to step 220
190 output label: first + " - " + second + " = " + result
195 skip to step 220
200 output label: first + " * " + second + " = " + result
205 skip to step 220
210 output label: first + " / " + second + " = " + result
215 skip to step 220
** see if they want to do another operation **
220 output prompt: "Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]: "
230 input nextCalc
240 if nextCalc is 'Y' skip to step 20
250 if nextCalc is 'N' skip to step 300
260 output label: "Couldn't understand you! Please type Y for yes or N for no if you want to do another calculation."
270 skip to step 220
300 EXIT

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user wants to evaluate 2 * 5 and 3 + 5
Input: first = 2, second = 5, operator = 3 , nextCalc = 'Y' then first = 3, second = 5, operator = 1, nextCalc= 'N'
Output: 2 * 5 = 10 , 3 + 5 = 8
10 Creates a 4 function calculator
20 Please enter first number:
30 first = 2
40 Please enter second number: 
50 second = 5
60 Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: 
70 operator = 3
80 true
110 false
120 true
160 result = 2 * 5 = 10
200 2 * 5 = 10
220 Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]: 
230 nextCalc = 'Y'
240 true
20 Please enter first number:
30 first = 3
40 Please enter second number: 
50 second = 5
60 Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: 
70 operator = 1
80 true
110 false
120 false
130 false
140 result = 3 + 5 = 8
220 Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]:
230 nextCalc = 'N'
300 EXIT

Test Case #2
I accidentally type in 5 for operator while trying to add 5.2 and 7.4
Input: first = 5.2, second = 7.4, operator = 5
Output: Invalid operator. Please type 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division
10 Creates a 4 function calculator
20 Please enter first number:
30 first = 5.2
40 Please enter second number: 
50 second = 7,4
60 Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: 
70 operator = 5
80 false
90 Invalid operator. Please type 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division

Test Case #3
I type in 'a' for the Another calculation question.
Input: first = -4.2, second = 33 , operator = 3
Output: Couldn't understand you! Please type Y for yes or N for no if you want to do another calculation.
10 Creates a 4 function calculator
20 Please enter first number:
30 first = -4.2
40 Please enter second number: 
50 second = 33
60 Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: 
70 operator = 3
80 true
110 false
120 true
160 result = -4.2 * 33 = -138.6
200 -4.2 * 33 = -138.6
220 Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]: 
230 nextCalc = 'a'
240 false
260 Couldn't understand you! Please type Y for yes or N for no if you want to do another calculation.
