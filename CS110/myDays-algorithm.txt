4. Test Cases
Test Case#1:
I type my real birthday: 6/17/1999
Input: years is 19, leapYears is 5, beforeDays is 168, remainingDays is 192
Expected results: 
DOB: June 17, 1999
Due: June 22, 2017
Age in Days: 6580
10 Calculate how many days old I will be by the due date of this assignment.
20 Enter the number of years I have lived, including my birth year and the current year (19) (-1 to EXIT): 
21 years = 19
22 false
26 true
30 Enter the number of leap years in my age (5): 
32 true
31 leapYears = 5
40 Enter the number of days in my birth year before I was born (168):
41 beforeDays = 168 
42 true
50 Enter the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date (192): 
52 true
55 remainingDays = 192 
60 set days = 0
61 set days = 0 + 365 * 19 = 6935
62 set days = 6935 + 5 = 6940
62 set days = 6940 - 168 = 6772
63 set days = 6772- 192 = 6580
70 set due = "June 22, 2017"
80 set dateOfBirth = "June 17, 1999"
90 DOB: June 17, 1999
100 Due: June 22, 2017
110 Age in Days: 6580
120 END

Test Case #2: 
I type my birthday incorrectly: 6/17/2017
Input: years is 1, leapYears is 0, beforeDays is 168, remainingDays is 192
Expected results: Not the right amount of years. Please reeenter the correct amount (19):
10 Calculate how many days old I will be by the due date of this assignment.
20 Enter the number of years I have lived, including my birth year and the current year (19) (-1 to EXIT): 
21 years = 0
22 true
26 false
27 Not the right amount of years. Please reeenter the correct amount (19):


Test Case #3: 
I don't type my birthday at all.
Input: -1 to exit
Expected Results: No birthday typed in
