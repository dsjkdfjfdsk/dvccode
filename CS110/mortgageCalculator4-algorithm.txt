*** Initialize values ***
19 create object mortgage
20 set mortgage.choices = 1
25 set password = "adf"
26 set mortgage.payback = 30
***Gets password***
30 output prompt: "Enter the password: "
40 input userPassword
50 if userPassword == password, skip to step 100
60 choices = choices + 1
70 if choices > 3, skip to step 90
80 skip to step 30
90 output label: "No correct passowords. Your three guesses are up."
95 skip to step 400
*** Get user input from file***
100 output prompt: "What's the input file? "
110 input filename
120 open file called filename
130 get mortgage.borrowed from line 1 of filename
140 if mortgage.borrowed > 0, skip to step 150
142 output label: "Invalid borrowed value. Please try again"

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user inputs 270000 as the amount borrowed and 5.125% as the annual rate
Input: filename = "text.txt" userPassword = "adf", mortgage.borrowed = 270000, mortgage.interest = 5.125
Output:
Amount borrowed: $270000
Annual interest rate: 5.125%
Payback period: 30 Years
Monthly payment: $1470.11
10 Collects all the mortgage data in a single item
19 object mortgage created
20 mortgage.choices = 1
25 password = "adf"
30 Enter the password: 
40 userPassword ="adf"
50 true
100 What's the input file? 
110 filename = "text.txt"
120 opened file called filename
130 mortgage.borrowed = 270000
140 true
150 mortgage.interest = 5.125
170 true
200 monthlyInterest = 5.125 / 12000 = .00042708333
210 monthlyPayback = 30 * 12 = 360
220 payment = (270000 * (1+ .00042708333)^360  * .00042708333) / ((1 + .00042708333)^360-1) = 1470.11
230 Amount borrowed: $270000
240 Annual interest rate: 5.125%
250 Payback period: 30 Years
255 mortgage.payment is formatted to 2 decimal places
260 Monthly payment: $1470.11
270 open mortgage.txt
