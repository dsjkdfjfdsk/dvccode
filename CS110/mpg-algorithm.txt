Course: COMSC-110-1021

1. Objective: Calculates the range possible with the remaining fuel given the capacity in gallons of the fuel tank and the miles/gallon

2. Requirements
INPUT: 
gallons
tank 
miles

PROCESSING: (a list of the major parts of the problem or objective (that will become the code blocks in a program))
1. getting user's gallons, tank, and miles
2. calculating miles/gallon and determine range possible
3. outputing user's lucky number, favorite movie, age, and first letter of his or her name. 

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
range

DATA: (name of data item, definition, data type, valid values)
gallons = number of gallons used on trip (0 or positive) (whole number) 
tank = capacity of the fuel tank in gallons (positive) (whole number) 
miles = miles traveled on trip in miles (0 or positive) (whole number) 
range = range possible with the remaining fuel in miles (0 or positive) (decimal) 
mpg = miles per gallon (0 or positive) (decimal) 
leftInTank = how many gallons left in the tank (0 or positive) (whole number)

3. Instructions
10 output the introduction: "Calculates the range possible with the remaining fuel"
*** getting the user's gallons ***
*** getting the user's tank ***
*** getting the user's miles ***
20 output prompt: "What's the capacity of your fuel tank (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)? "
30 input tank
31 if tank is -9999, skip to 200
32 if tank is a positive whole number, skip to step 40
33 output prompt: "Invalid tank. Please type a positive whole number greater than 0: "
34 skip to step 30
40 output prompt "How many gallons have you used (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)? "
50 input gallons 
51 if gallons is -9999, skip to 200
52 if gallons is less than or equal to the tank, skip to step 55
53 output label: "Gallons you used must be less than or equal to the tank capacity"
54 skip to step 40
55 if gallons is a positive whole number or 0, skip to step 60
56 output prompt: "Invalid gallons. Please type a positive whole number greater or equal to 0: "
57 skip to step 50
60 output prompt: "How many miles have you travelled (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)? "
70 input miles 
71 if miles is -9999, skip to 200
75 if miles is a positive whole number or 0, skip to step 90
77 output prompt: "Invalid miles. Please type a positive whole number greater or equal to 0: "
78 skip to step 70
*** Calucations ***
90 mpg = miles / gallons
100 leftInTank = gallons % tank
110 range = leftInTank * mpg
*** Output Results ***
120 output label: "You can travel " + range + " miles with the fuel you have left"
200 END or EXIT

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:	and the expected results:
A person travelled 20 miles, used up 10 gallons of gas, tank has 5 gallons capacity
Input: miles = 20, gallons = 10, tank = 50
Output: You can travel 80 miles with the fuel you have left
10 Calculates the range possible with the remaining fuel
20 What's the capacity of your fuel tank (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)?
30 tank = 50
31 false
32 true
40 How many gallons have you used (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)? 
50 gallons = 10
51 false
55 true
60 How many miles have you travelled (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)?
70 miles = 20
71 false
75 true
90 mpg = 20 / 10 = 2.0
100 leftInTank = 50 - 10 = 40
110 range = 40 * 2.0 = 80.0
120 You can travel 80 miles with the fuel you have left
200 END

Test Case#2
The user enters -20 for the fuel tank capacity
Input: tank = -20
Output: Invalid tank. Please type a positive whole number greater than 0: 
10 Calculates the range possible with the remaining fuel
20 What's the capacity of your fuel tank (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)? 
30 tank = -20
31 false
32 false
33 Invalid tank. Please type a positive whole number greater than 0: 

Test Case#3
The user enters 20 for the fuel tank capacity, and 50 for the gallons
Input: tank = 20, gallons = 50
Output: Gallons you used must be less than or equal to the tank capacity
10 Calculates the range possible with the remaining fuel
20 What's the capacity of your fuel tank (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)?
30 tank = 20
31 false
32 true
40 How many gallons have you used (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)? 
50 gallons = 50
51 false
52 true
53 Gallons you used must be less than or equal to the tank capacity

Test Case#4: 
The user exits immedietly
Input: tank = -9999
Output: 
10 Calculates the range possible with the remaining fuel
20 What's the capacity of your fuel tank (whole number greater or equal to 0) (-9999 to END)?
30 tank = -9999
31 true
200 END
