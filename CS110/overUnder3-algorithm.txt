Course: COMSC-110-1021

1. Objective: User guesses a number between 1 and 10 and sees if it's correct

2. Requirements
INPUT:
guess

PROCESSING:
1. Generate random number
2. Get user's guess
3. Compare user input to the random number and output results as well as see if it's been asked before and continue steps 2-3 until input is correct

OUTPUT:
message (either gonna be "Try again..." or "You guessed it. Congrats!" or "I really want a number between 1 and 10 (type -1 to EXIT):")

DATA:
guess = the user's guess (whole number) (1-100)
number = the correct number which is randomly generated (whole number) (1-100)
listGuesses = list of every user guess (list)

3. Instructions
10 output the introduction: "User guesses a number between 1 and 100 and sees if it's correct"
15 create listGuesses
*** getting the user input ***
20 output the prompt: "What is your guess [1-100] (whole number): "
30 input guess
31 if guess is -1, skip to step 200
32 if guess is not a number guessed previously (from the listGuesses), skip to step 35
33 output label: "You already guessed" + guess + ". Guess again"
34 skip to step 30
35 if guess is between 1-100, skip to step 38
36 output the label: "I really want a number between 1 and 100 (type -1 to EXIT): "
37 skip to step 30
38 add guess to listGuesses
*** generate random number ***
40 number = rand() % 100 + 1
*** compares guess to correct number to see if it is corret or not ***
50 if guess is equal to number, skip to step 120
60 if guess is smaller than number, skip to step 90
70 output label: "That's too high. guess again: "
80 skip to step 30
90 if guess is bigger than number, skip to step 70
100 output label: "That's too low. guess again: "
110 skip to step 30
120 output the label: "You guessed it. Congrats!"
200 EXIT

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user guesses 4 and gets it correctly
Input: guess = 4
Output: You guessed it. Congrats!
10 User guesses a number between 1 and 100 and sees if it's correct
15 listGuesses created
20 What is your guess [1-100] (whole number): 
30 guess = 4
31 false
32 true
40 number = rand() % 100 + 1 = 4
50 true
120 You guessed it. Congrats!
200 EXIT

Test Case #2:
The user guesses -1
Input: guess = -1
Output: 
10 User guesses a number between 1 and 100 and sees if it's correct
15 listGuesses created
20 What is your guess [1-100] (whole number): 
30 guess = -1
31 true
200 End

Test Case #3:
The user guesses a number already in the list such as 2. 
Input: guess = 2, guess = 2
Output: You already guessed 2. Guess again
10 User guesses a number between 1 and 100 and sees if it's correct
15 listGuesses created
20 What is your guess [1-100] (whole number): 
30 guess = 2
31 false
32 true
40 number = rand() % 100 + 1 = 4
50 false
60 false
20 What is your guess [1-100] (whole number): 
30 guess = 2
31 false
32 false
33 You already guessed 2. Guess again

Test Case #4:
The user inputs -100
Input: guess = -100
Output: I really want a number between 1 and 100 (type -1 to EXIT): 
10 User guesses a number between 1 and 100 and sees if it's correct
15 listGuesses created
20 What is your guess [1-100] (whole number): 
30 guess = 2
31 false
32 true
35 false
36 I really want a number between 1 and 100 (type -1 to EXIT):
