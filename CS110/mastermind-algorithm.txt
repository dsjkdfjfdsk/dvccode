1. Objective: Play the Mastermind game

2. Requirements
INPUT:
guess

PROCESSING:
1. Get user guess for the 4 letter combination
2. Evaluate how many correct colors they got and correct positions they got compared to the computer choices

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
correctColors
correctPositions

DATA:
guess = 4 letter combination of B, G, R, Y, O, and P inputted by user (text) (Any 4 letter combination of B for Blue, G for Green, R for Red, O for Orange, Y for Yellow, and P for Pink)
computerChoices = 4 letter combination of B, G, R, Y, O, and P randomly generated by computer (text) (Any 4 letter combination of B for Blue, G for Green, R for Red, O for Orange, Y for Yellow, and P for Pink)
correctColors = Number of correct colors (whole number) (0-4)
correctPositions = Number of correct positions (whole number) (0-4)
counter = counter value for checking each letter (whole number)

3. Instructions
subprogram guessValidation
5 counter = 0
10 output prompt: "What's your 4 letter guess? (Type "QQQQ" to quit") (Any 4 letter combination of B for Blue, G for Green, R for Red, O for Orange, Y for Yellow, and P for Pink): "
20 input guess
25 if guess in uppercase is "QQQQ" skip to step 100
30 if length of guess is equal to 4, skip to step 55
40 output label: "Invalid length of guess. Please type a 4 letter combination."
50 skip to step 10
55 if counter bigger than or equal to 4, skip to step 100
60 if guess[counter] to uppercase is B, G, R, Y, O, or P, skip to step 75
70 output label: "Invalid character in guess. Please use B, G, R, Y, O, or P in your guess."
75 counter = counter + 1
80 skip to step 55
100 RETURN from subprogram guessValidation with guess 

subprogram evaluateAnswer
*** Calculate the number of correct positions and Calculate the number of correct colors***
10 counter = 0
15 if counter is bigger than or equal to 4, skip to step 90
20 if guess[counter] is not equal to computerChoices[counter], skip to step 25
21 correctPositions = correctPositions + 1
25 if guess[counter] is not equal to computerChoices[0], computerChoices[1], computerChoices[2], or computerChoices[3], skip to step 30
26 correctColors = correctColors + 1
30 counter = counter + 1
40 skip to step 15
*** Output results ***
90 output label: "The number of correct colors is: " + correctColors
100 output label: "The number of correct positions is: " + correctPositions
110 RETURN from subprogram evaluateAnswer 

main algorithm
10 output introduction: "Plays the Mastermind game."
20 output instructions: "The objective of Mastermind is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs B for Blue, G for Green, R for Red, O for Orange, Y for Yellow, and P for Pink)" 
30 set counter = 0
40 set correctColors = 0
50 set correctPositions = 0 
*** Randomly generate computer ***
55 randomly generate and assign computerChoices
*** Get User guess ***
60 get guess from subprogram guessValidation
*** Exits if user signals to ***
65 if guess is "QQQQ", skip to step 200
*** Compare values ***
80 go to subprogram evaluateAnswer
*** End program or not ***
110 if correctColors is 4 and correctPositions is 4, skip to step 130
120 skip to step 60
*** If the user won ***
130 output label: "You Won! Congrats!"

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:
The user guesses "RGYB", computer generated answer is "RGYB"
Input: guess = "RGYB"
Output: 
The number of correct colors is: 4
The number of correct positions is: 4
You Won! Congrats!
