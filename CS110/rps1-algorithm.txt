1. Objective: Play a rock, paper, scissors game

2. Requirements
INPUT:
userPlay

PROCESSING:
1. Get players move for playing, randomly generate a computer's choice for a move
2. Calculate the winner and output the results and see if the user wants to play again. 

OUTPUT:
Introduction (says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
computerPlayC
userPlay
computerScore
userScore

DATA:
userPlay = user's choice of move (character) (R or r for rock, P or p for paper, S or s for scissors, or Q or q to quit)
computerPlay = computer's choice of move (int) (0-2) (0 for rock, 1 for paper, 2 for scissors)
computerPlayC = computer's choice of move expressed in a character (character) (R for rock, P for paper, S for scissors)
computerScore = current score of the computer (int) (all whole numbers that are 0 or positive)
userScore = current score of the user (int) (all whole numbers that are 0 or positive)
continueYN = if the user wants to continue or not (char) (y or n)

*** Get user's play choice ***
30 output prompt: "What's your choice? (R or r for rock, P or p for paper, S or s for scissors, or Q or q to quit): "
40 input userPlay
50 if userPlay is R or r, P or p, S or s, skip to step 80
55 if userPlay is not Q or q, skip to step 60
56 output label: "Thanks for playing"
57 skip to step 300
60 output label: "Invalid choice. Please try again."
70 skip to step 30
*** Generate computer's choice and express it in a character***
80 computerPlay = rand() % 3
81 if computerPlay is 0, skip to 84

147 if userPlay is R or r, skip to step 180
160 output label: "Your choice: " + userPlay + ", Computer's choice: " + computerPlayC + ", You lost."
162 computerScore = computerScore + 1
162 skip to step 200
170 output label: "Your choice: " + userPlay + ", Computer's choice: " + computerPlayC + ", You tied."
172 computerScore = computerScore + 1
173 userScore = userScore + 1
174 skip to step 200
180 output label: "Your choice: " + userPlay + ", Computer's choice: " + computerPlayC + ", You won!"
182 userScore = userScore + 1
