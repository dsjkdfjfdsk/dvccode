1. Objective: Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
height

PROCESSING:
1. getting each height of everyone in the room. 
2. getting the total number of people in the room.
3. sum the height of each person in the room.
4. dividing the sum of the heights by the number of people in the room. 

OUTPUT:
Introduction (which says what the objective is, who the author is, any user instructions)
average

DATA:
count = number of people in the room (whole number)
height = height of each person in the room in centimeters (number) (more than 0 cm, less than 247 cm)
sum = total of all heights of all the people in the room (whole number)
average = the average age of all the people in the room (decimal)

3. Instructions
10. output the introduction: "Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom"
15. set sum = 0
16. set count = 0
17. set average = 0
*** gettting the height of everyone in the room in centimeters (metric system since it's most widely used in US and abroad) ***
*** getting the total number of people in the room ***
*** sum all the height of the people in the room ***
18. If there are no people in the room, jump to step 90. 
20. output the prompt: "What is your height?"
30. input height
35. if height is not larger than 0 and less than 8, jump to step 90. 
40. set sum = sum + age
50. set count = count + 1
60. if there are uncounted people left in the room, then skip to instruction 20
*** calculate the average height***
70. set average = sum / count
80. output label "the average height of everyone in the classroom is " + average
90. END or EXIT


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested:     and  Input values if any:	and the expected results:
There are 3 people in the room
Input: heights are 100 cm, 100 cm, 130 cm
Expected results: count = 3, sum = 330 , average = 330/3 = 110
10 Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
18 False
20 What is your height?
30 height = 100 
35 False
40 sum = 0 + 100 = 100 
50 count = 0 + 1 = 1
60 True so skip to instruction 20
20 What is your height?
30 height = 100 
35 False
40 sum = 100 + 100 = 200
50 count = 1 + 1 = 2
60 True so skip to instruction 20
20 What is your height?
30 height = 130 
35 False
40 sum = 200 + 130 = 330
50 count = 2 + 1 =3
60 False
70 average = 330 / 3 = 110
80 The average height of everyone in the classroom is 110
90 DONE

Test Case #2: 
There are 3 people in the room
Input: heights are 0, 10, 129
Expected results: Invalid height, try again
10 Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your height?
30 height = -1
35 True
90 DONE

Test Case #3: 
There are 0 people in the classroom
Input:
Expected Results: There are no people in the classroom
10 Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
18 True
90 DONE

Test Case #4:
There is 1 person in the classroom
Input: height is 800
Expected Results: Invalid height, try again
10 Calculate the average height of everyone in the classroom
15 sum = 0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your height?
30 height = 200
35 False
